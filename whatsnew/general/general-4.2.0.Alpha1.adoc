== General for JBoss Tools 4.2.0.Alpha1

JBoss Tools is now targeting Eclipse Luna. 

In Luna M4 there currently are known issues with Eclipse SWT and
GTK3 on various Linux distribution like Fedora 20.

You can try run with `EXPORT SWT_GTK3=0` which make SWT used GTK2
which might will reduce some crashes.
