== Create from template
You can now use templates to create OpenShift resources with JBoss Tools. 
The wizard allows you to use a template offered by the server but you can also choose to provide a template that you have ready on your disk.

To figure out what url we need to open, we look at the routes in your OpenShift project.

== Import to Eclipse project
An OpenShift project can now get imported to Eclipse in JBoss Tools. 
The import wizard prompts you to select a build config since it contains the uri of your source repository. 
The wizard then clones the given git uri and import the code within it to your Eclipse workspace/project.

It currently detects maven projects and imports those a such. 
All other projects will get imported as general projects that you can manually configure to match your needs. 
We will obviously improve this detection in upcoming releases via the new Eclipse https://wiki.eclipse.org/E4/UI/Smart_Import["Smart Import"] facility.
