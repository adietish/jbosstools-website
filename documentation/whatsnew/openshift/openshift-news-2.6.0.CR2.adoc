== OpenShift Server Adapter now supports JEE7
Prior to JBoss Tools 4.2.0.CR2 one could not deploy JEE 7 projects to OpenShift. 
The OpenShift server adapter complained that it was not supporting version 3.1 of the J2EE Web module specification. 
In this new milestone we now fixed this.

== Disable bad SSL Ciphers
JBoss Tools could not connect to OpenShift when run on openjdk 1.7/Linux while the server was running on Red Hat Enterprise 6.6. 
OpenJDK 1.8, Oracle JDKs, Windows and MacOS machines were not affected.
This was caused by the server offering DHE cipher keys larger than 1024 bits. 
The cipher provider in openjdk 1.7/linux were not able to handle these and failed handshaking (see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1131221).
OpenJDK fixed this bug with openjdk-1.7.0.71 (see https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1633.html). 
For our users that are stuck with the failing combination we offer the following system property that disabels the faulty DHE ciphers:
We now allow you to disable the causing cipher with the following system property (the flag is off by default):

 -Ddisable_bad_sslciphers=yes

You can add this to your eclipse.ini and avoid the problem. +
We also provide an automatic mode where we test the jdk for it's ability to handle DHE cipher keys > 1024 bits and disable the DHE ciphers accordingly:

 -Ddisable_bad_sslciphers=auto

== Incorrect output directory for Wildfly (Quickstart)
When you try to deploy an existing project to OpenShift the tooling gladly assists you and adds the OpenShift maven profile to the pom.xml in your project.
When using a Wilfly 8.1 Quickstart the tooling created an incorrect outputDirectory in the OpenShift profile causing the deployment to fail. We fixed this for CR2.
