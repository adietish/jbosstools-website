== JBoss Maven Integration
=== Maven Profile Management UI 	

We contributed the Maven Profile Management UI to https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=428094[the m2e project]. You get the same features, the Ctrl+Alt+P shortcut still works but all that is now part of m2e itself (starting from m2e 1.5 Luna M6). 

The Maven Profile Management feature was removed from the JBoss Tools update site and the Red Hat Developer Studio installer.
